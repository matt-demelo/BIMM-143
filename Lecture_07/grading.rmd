## A function to grade homework assignments

First we start with two student grade vectors:

```{r}
s1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
s2 <- c(100, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
```

Now we try to drop their lowest grades, trying with student 1 first:

```{r}
mins1 = min(s1)
s1adj = s1[(s1 != mins1)]
s1adj
```

```{r}
newgrade <- function(stdt1, stdt2){
  mins1 = min(stdt1)
  mins2 = min(stdt2)
  
  s1adj = stdt1[(stdt1 != mins1)]
  s2adj = stdt2[(stdt2 != mins2)]
  
  mean(s1adj,s2adj)
}
  
```

```{r}
grade1 <- function(s1,s2){
  sum min length!
}
```
